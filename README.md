### FINAL

this is my final clock - I will explain what each part does:

- the sun: this is the middle circle - in the circle it displays the time, as well as current circadian rythm. (i.e. at 7 oclock melatonin secretion starts, and at 10 oclock your mind is highest alert.)

- the earth: this controls what hour of the day it is; it moves in a clockwise fashion and makes one loop every 24 hours. This is a movement based of an analog clock.

- the moon: this rotates around the earth - just like the actual moon. it makes one full turn around the earth every hour.

- the commet/asteroid: this makes one full turn around the whole system every minute. I origionally wanted to make make it crash into the sun during the alarm - but everythign I tried was either too complicated or didn't work the way I wanted it to.

- the supernova: this is what happens when the alarm is activated (by clicking anywhere on the clock) There is an orange sun behind the regualr sun which flashes as if to turn the sun into 'a supernova'. This is not very realistic ina physical sense, but I liked the way it went with my design.


The outcome: I am very happy with my design - I have always been interested in the solar system - I origionally though of this idea becase the solar system and rotation of the earth around the sun is what early humans used to tell/ represent the time (they also used it to tell circadian rythems which I have included). I like my design because it is a visual representation of that - as well as mixed with tradtional media (digital clock)
